If you want to run code, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run "npm install" in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment because that would bloat the ZIP file)
2. Run "npm run serve" to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:7777 (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
